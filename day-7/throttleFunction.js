/* 
Problem 32: Throttle Function  [Medium]
Description: Write a throttle(fn, limit) function that ensures fn is called at most once every limit milliseconds.
Example:
const throttledScroll = throttle(onScroll, 200);// Fires at most once every 200ms during scroll
Hint: Track the last call time with Date.now().
*/

const throttle = (fn, limit) => {
  let lastCall = 0;
  return (...args) => {
    const now = Date.now();
    if (now - lastCall >= limit) {
      lastCall = now;
      fn(...args);
    }
  };
};

const onScroll = () => {
  console.log("Scrolled!");
};
