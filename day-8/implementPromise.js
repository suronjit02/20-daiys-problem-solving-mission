/* Problem 38: Implement Promise.all from Scratch  [Hard]
Description: Write a function myPromiseAll(promises) that behaves like Promise.all — resolves with an array of results when all resolve, rejects immediately if any rejects.
Example:
myPromiseAll([p1, p2, p3]).then(results => console.log(results));
Hint: Track resolved count and results array; reject on first failure.
